# Conversion from html into Express

Biggest take-away: treating JS files as static files as well like the CSS and images/logos etc.  The purpose and reason to do so is that JS written in EJS is rendering the files of the HTML in its generation.  Meanwhile, the JS files that are running different scripts on the HTML page itself are running after the HTML page has initialized.  Once that understanding came to light, it made it make sense that the JS files needed to be located in the "static folder" created for these JS scripts to run after the HTML page initialization, which is why the nav bar hamburgers worked previously when working on the files earlier.
